<h3><i>Using This Handbook</i></h3>
<p>Grand Teton National Park offers the startling and
abrupt scenic grandeur of the Teton Range and the
colorful history and natural history of the valley
called Jackson Hole. Other major attractions include
the Snake River, Jackson Lake, and surprisingly
good opportunities for viewing wildlife, including
such larger mammals as elk, moose, and pronghorns.
This handbook is published in support of the
National Park Service&rsquo;s management policies and
interpretive programs at the park. Part 1 introduces
the park through the eyes of a beloved, longtime
Jackson Hole resident, the nationally known conservationist
Margaret E. (Mardy) Murie; Part 2 outlines
the natural history, geology, and history of the
mountains, valley, and river; and Part 3 presents concise
travel guide and reference materials.</p>
<p>National Park Handbooks, compact introductions to
the great natural and historic places administered by
the National Park Service, are designed to promote
understanding and enjoyment of the parks. Each is
intended to be informative reading and a useful
guide before, during, and after a park visit. More
than 100 titles are in print. This is Handbook 122.</p>

<h3 id="c2">What Gratitude We Owe
<br /><i>By Margaret E. Murie</i></h3>
<p>A bronze plaque at the doorway of the Maude Noble
Cabin on the banks of the Snake River at Moose,
Wyoming, recounts a notable meeting in 1923. It was
a meeting at which &ldquo;... Mr. Struthers Burt, Dr.
Horace Carncross, Mr. John L. Eynon, Mr. J. R.
Jones and Mr. Richard Winger, all residents of
Jackson Hole, presented to Mr. Horace Albright,
then Superintendent of Yellowstone National Park,
a plan for setting aside a portion of Jackson Hole as a
National Recreation Area for the use and enjoyment
of the people of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plaque commemorates both the beginning
and the end of a stormy period&mdash;from 1918 on into
the 1950s&mdash;in Jackson Hole&rsquo;s history. Those meeting
at Miss Noble&rsquo;s simple log cabin wanted to devise a
way to save the valley&rsquo;s natural beauty from commercial
exploitation. They wanted it protected by a
public agency. These few people recognized the
need for safeguarding a meaningful segment of our
country from the uses of commerce. Their idea did
not catch on immediately.</p>
<p>In 1926 Horace Albright escorted John D.
Rockefeller, Jr., and family into Jackson Hole, and a
bright hope for this valley was born. Albright
imparted to Rockefeller his vision of the whole
valley as a national park. Rockefeller said nothing
then but later admitted that Albright&rsquo;s vision had set
his own dreams in motion. A land company was
formed to shield Rockefeller&rsquo;s involvement, and it
began to purchase valley parcels. Unaware of this,
Congress voted to create a Grand Teton National
Park in 1929. The park was only about one-third the
size of today&rsquo;s park, protecting only the immediate
mountain range, and very little of the valley floor.</p>

<p>The 150 square miles of mostly mountain land then
comprising Grand Teton National Park were not
enough to safeguard the complete ecosystem of the
valley. Through his agents, Rockefeller quietly purchased
ranches and other private lands in upper
Jackson Hole, where the soil was not good for
ranching and some ranchers were having a hard
time. In the avowed purpose of later turning them
over to the Federal Government, Rockefeller was
carrying out the aims of those who had met at
Maude Noble&rsquo;s cabin. And through all the following
stormy years; through the establishment by proclamation
of Franklin D. Roosevelt of the Jackson Hole
National Monument to contain the Rockefeller-purchased
lands; through all the opposition to it;
through the eventual negotiated &ldquo;peace&rdquo; and the
addition of all the monument lands to Grand Teton
National Park by Congress in 1950, the Rockefeller
family held to its goal of &ldquo;a complete project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So now, after all the years and all the tumult, the
cattlemen have their grazing rights on the national
forest lands and the right to drift their cattle across
national park lands to reach those permits: people
still have their homes, dudes still come to the dude
ranches. No one, Oldtimer or Newcomer, would now
deny that the national park has vitalized the economy
of the valley a thousandfold. These material
results are quite obvious. Our problem now is not
the amount of lands that are under State, private, or
Federal jurisdiction, but whether or not we can keep
our souls receptive to the message of peace these
unspoiled lands offer us.</p>
<p>In my many years living in this valley called
Jackson Hole, I have sometimes had half-waking
fantasies about how such a very special place came
to be. One could almost imagine that 50 or 60 million
years ago some great force purposely set about to
create a valley as beautiful as any valley could be. A
step further into fantasy, one might imagine this
great force saying: &ldquo;Let us start, of course, with
mountains. I shall raise up a block of granite from
the Earth planet&rsquo;s interior; over the centuries it will
become a magnificent 14,000 feet high; time and the
winds and waters will sculpt it. Looking across to it
will be other hills and mountains, and glaciers will
form the valley and then melt away and there will be
waters and streams flowing through. But with only
the winds and waters singing, it will be too quiet, it
will not be alive, so there must be animals&mdash;mammals,
birds, fish, frogs, toads, butterflies, and all the rest.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Fritiof Fryxell, the first ranger naturalist of the
park, has described the forming of these peaks:
&ldquo;With continued uplift came a stage when the passing
air currents, in surmounting the block, were
compelled to rise so high that their moisture
condensed. Precipitation over the elevated region
was thereby increased. The streams, ever gaining in
volume and velocity, now flowed along with the fine
enthusiasm and vigor of youth, and like a group of
skilled artisans singing at their work, went about
their business of sculpturing the range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within this space the Creator must have intended
to bring man in humility to his knees. Imagine
traveling into the range from either south or north,
toward its center. The peaks loom ever higher and
steeper and more dramatic until, as Fryxell points
out, with the 6.5 kilometers (4 miles) between
Avalanche and Cascade, two of the canyons piercing
the range, there stand in close ranks the South,
Middle, and Grand Teton, Mt. Owen, Teewinot, Nez
Perce, Cloudveil Dome, and many spires. These
form an overwhelming Gothic assemblage of peaks, a
concentrated and unforgettable mountain experience
for anyone. And it all goes on, and on, and on, north
or south, from there.</p>
<p>This is the Teton Range, but it is not the whole
picture. The glaciers that during the Ice Age came
through the whole valley left lakes as a row of jewels
at the feet of the peaks: Phelps, Taggart, Bradley,
Jenny, Leigh, and then finally Jackson lakes, through
which the Snake River travels for some 17 miles
southward. From the lakes the flat glacial floor extends
to meet the river in mid-valley and beyond
to all the other beautiful, though not quite so spectacular,
mountains and hills that form the north,
east, and south walls of the valley known as Jackson
Hole.</p>
<p>Those &ldquo;other mountains&rdquo; are the Yellowstone Plateau
to the north, the Absaroka, the Washakie, and
Gros Ventre, merging southward into the Hoback
and Snake River Ranges. It is immediately clear why
the first mountain men called this type of valley a
hole. As the Snake winds its way south from its
source in a high mountain meadow in southern
Yellowstone National Park, into and out of Jackson
Lake, it is joined by other streams: Pacific Creek,
the Buffalo River, the Gros Ventre. All are bordered
by cottonwood and aspen and spruce and fir forests.
The scene is one of infinite variety, and in summer it
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
is aglow with wildflowers of every hue. When I first
entered the valley in mid-July of 1927, I thought
surely I was entering a fairyland.</p>
<p>We know that for many hundreds of years the
Indians came to this valley to hunt and fish, but not
to stay. They left the land nearly untouched. Then in
the early 1800s came the mountain men to harvest
the beaver. And the valley became the favorite of
one David Jackson, for whom it was named by his
fur trade partner, William Sublette, in 1829, 100
years before Grand Teton National Park was
established.</p>
<p>The first white settlers came to the hole about
1884, settling first in the southern part of the valley.
Grass grew there and hay could be raised. Cattle
could live there. But it was a demanding environment.
The settlers worked hard all summer and battled
cold and deep snow in winter, feeding their stock by
horse-drawn sleigh or on snowshoes. Much could be
written about their survival techniques, but what
interests us here in connection with the national
park is that the life they led nurtured a bold and
independent spirit. They believed in their &ldquo;first
rights&rdquo; to this part of the world, and resisted anything
threatening their independence and proprietary
feelings. Most of what is now the national park
was part of Teton National Forest in 1929, and
cattlemen had grazing rights on the forest. Naturally
they were flamingly opposed to anything that might
change their privileges. This was the human background
for the long drama of saving a good portion
of Jackson Hole in its natural state, for the benefit of
untold generations of people from all over the world.</p>

<p>Teton country was a part of the West where,
thankfully, gold was not an issue. An oldtimer once
left this notice on a Snake River gravel bar:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Payin gold will never be found here</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>No matter how many men tries</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>There&rsquo;s some enough to begile one</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Like tanglefoot paper does flies.</i></p>
</div>
<p>That left cattle as the only &ldquo;gold,&rdquo; with their owners
ready to fight for what they considered their rights.
The puzzling yet invigorating diversity among people
is part of the long evolution of the human spirit.
Jackson Hole was and still is a fascinating microcosm
reflecting these diversities, and they all played
roles in the long controversy that colors the history
of this great national park.</p>

<p>One of the valley&rsquo;s most famous residents, author
Struthers Burt, once wrote: &ldquo;I am afraid for my own
country unless some help is given it&mdash;some wise
direction. It is too beautiful and now too famous.
Sometimes I dream of it unhappily.&rdquo; When Burt
wrote this there had irrupted at Jenny Lake and
nearby, in front of the most impressive view of the
main Teton peaks, a gasoline station, tourist cabins,
a hot dog stand, a dance hall, and some rusting
bodies of automobiles. No wonder he dreamed
unhappily. But &ldquo;some wise direction&rdquo; did come. All
the old blight along the highway has been removed
and today there is a small ranger station, a tents-only
campground, camper store, a small visitor center,
and a small boat dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The American public will not leave Jackson Hole
alone; nor can we ask them to,&rdquo; my husband, Olaus,
wrote in 1943. &ldquo;They will be coming in increasing
numbers. In any situation involving large numbers of
us, some regulation becomes a necessity, whether
we like it or not.... It should be our ambition to
assist all agencies to keep intact this one segment of
America that we boast of as &lsquo;the last of the Old
West.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indians hunted and fished in this valley for all
those hundreds of years and left no mark. The white
man has been here less than one hundred and has
left many marks. Today we have enlarged Grand
Teton National Park, and the staff of the park now
copes with a flow of nearly three million visitors
each year.</p>
<p>On the edges and outskirts of the park, we still
have the cloud of what Robert Righter describes in
his history of the park as &ldquo;the threats of subdivision
and mammonism.&rdquo; Righter bemoans the damper
such activities can put on the human spirit otherwise
inspired by the mountain range. &ldquo;It seems important,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;that future generations know that the Park
commemorates not only the grandeur of nature but
also the spirit of men acting for a noble cause; it is a
park not of chance but of man&rsquo;s design.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today, come to this national park with an open
mind, open eyes, and an open heart. Leave your
conveyance; walk the trails up into the canyons,
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
around the lakes, into the hills, canoe on some of the
lakes. Stand quietly at dusk by a beaver pond and
you may see a moose or two or three, some ducks, a
great blue heron, a pair of trumpeter swans. The list
is long of what may be seen. And the list is equally
long&mdash;or longer&mdash;of what may be heard if you stand
quietly: the song of the Swainson&rsquo;s thrush or the
ruby-crowned kinglet, the raucous conversation of
ravens, the chatter of pine squirrels, the rattling call
of sandhill cranes.</p>
<p>Go by foot or canoe or kayak or on a quiet horse
or, in winter, on cross-country skis. You will sense
the full and busy and yet harmonious life pattern of
the wild ones. It will come to mean something very
special to you, for it is a balm and a benediction. It is
a reminder of your primeval roots. Stand at the edge
of some woods at night and hear a great-horned owl
hooting; perhaps, if you are lucky, coyotes singing;
or, after September 1, some bull elk bugling.</p>
<p>Be glad they are all still here. These quiet adventures
will remain with you always. And think then,
too, what might have happened in this valley, and
what gratitude we owe a few.</p>

<h3 id="c4">The Mountains</h3>
<p>The tight concentration of tall peaks and pinnacles
called the Cathedral Group has been described as
&ldquo;Chartres multiplied by six, a choir of shimmering
granite spires soaring high above the nave and
transept of the valley below.&rdquo; Few fail to be impressed
by these most scenic of mountains and by their
staggering panoramic quality. Theodore Roosevelt,
so often given to eloquence, called this &ldquo;the most
beautiful country in the world.&rdquo; You may find yourself
spending an inordinate amount of time just
staring at the mountains.</p>
<p>The Tetons, being classic fault-block mountains,
were originally mound-like, not jagged and spired.
They were formed as the Earth cracked along a
north-south line at the base of the mountains. As the
Earth&rsquo;s outer crust faulted under pressures deep
within its mantle, the western block tilted upward
and the eastern block sank. We speak about this
mountain building in the past tense because, for us
mortals, mountains symbolize eternity. But the action
continues.</p>
<p>The Tetons are the youngest mountains in the
Rocky Mountain system, but they are made out of
some of the oldest rock in North America. The
granitic gneisses and schists north and south of the
central, highest peaks are some of the hardest and
least porous rocks known. The rock of the Grand
Teton is a younger granite. These qualities, and the
accessibility of major peaks, attract technical rock
climbers. The handholds are secure and the views
breathtaking.</p>
<p>The geologic time scale is so vast we cannot
imagine it. Most of us simply refuse to imagine more
than a few thousand years: we find anything greater
too inhibiting. The Ice Age ended its major glacial
action about 10,000 years ago, the beginning of the
Holocene or the Recent, as early man wandered the
glacial ice margins. But seven-eighths of Earth history
are tied up in the Precambrian Period, the period of
formation of the Teton Range&rsquo;s 3.5-billion-year-old
rocks. By contrast, just east of Jackson Hole&mdash;Thermopolis
on your Wyoming highway map&mdash;there is now
forming the youngest rock in the United States, travertine.
Further proof that geologic processes continue.</p>
<p>The massive Teton Range contains a miniaturized
world on a different time scale. The alpine world is a
summer surprise because it offers flowering displays
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
long after the valley show concludes for the season.
Bloom time is delayed by ascending altitude: the
rule of thumb is about 12 days delay per 1,000
feet. If you miss the yellow buttercups at lower
elevations, climb higher and you may overtake their
montane flowering in full bloom. Such are the rigors
of alpine tundra life that here the flowers largely
depend on wind for pollination, or on flies, rather
than on bees. Bees cannot withstand the cold temperatures
so common at these heights. The alpine
insect explosion is brief, but ants, ladybugs and other
beetles, and diminutive grasshoppers inhabit the
alpine world. They make fast food for alpine-nesting
birds, such as pipits, horned larks, white-crowned
sparrows, and rosy finches that are desperately trying
to nourish their hungry broods between the two edges
of winter.</p>
<p>Specialized and severe, the alpine world is sparsely
populated. Here eagles and weasels hunt for bird
nestlings, marmots, pikas, pocket gophers, deer mice,
and voles. The heartbeat of the extremely fragile
tundra is slow by necessity. That any plants have
adapted to this environment seems incredible. Yet
alpine laurel fills rock crevices. Spring beauty blooms
in pockets of soil. Mats of moss campion carpet
slopes of shattered rock. White columbine nod in
the wind shadows of larger rocks. Alpine sunflowers
blaze like a galaxy of equal suns, their disproportionately
large flowers awkwardly seated on abbreviated
stalks.</p>
<p>The process of developing from bare rock to fully
developed alpine vegetation might require thousands
of years. By contrast, it is estimated that 100
years are required to form one inch of soil on the
plains. On alpine heights the rate is many times
slower. The first plants to colonize bare mountain
rock might be lichens, multi-colored crustose plants
adapted to extreme conditions. Lichens are tough.
They grow on rocky outcrops near the South and
North Poles. They also thrive on desert rocks that
are too hot to touch. Lichen plants can first be dried
in air and then in a dessicator and then exposed to
514&deg;F for up to seven hours and yet, upon return to
room temperatures, they will resume normal metabolism.
And lichens regulate, to some extent, water
flow at high elevations. On dry days their water
content may be from two to ten percent of dry
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
weight. On rainy days that may soar to more than
300 percent. Mats of lichen hold so much moisture
that even a rise in barometric pressure may press
some water out to resume its tortuous trip toward
the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Seven Teton peaks exceed 12,000 feet and one, the
Grand Teton, pushes above 13,000 feet to 13,770
feet in elevation. At such heights, conditions support
mountain glaciers. The Teton Glacier is one of about
a dozen small alpine glaciers cradled in shaded
east- or north-facing cirques among the high peaks.
Teton Glacier occupies a spectacular cirque that
faces east between the north face of the Grand and
Mount Owen. It is partially fed by avalanches from
the cliffs around it. Some of these cliffs are more
than 3,000 feet high. The glacier&rsquo;s terminus has
retreated markedly since 1929, but the rate of loss
was less between 1954 and 1963 than it was between
1929 and 1954. The mountain glaciers in today&rsquo;s
Tetons are not left over from the Ice Age. They
began forming about 500 to 1,000 years ago, during
the so-called Little Ice Age.</p>
<p>As insignificant as these glaciers are compared to
the colossal sheets that repeatedly lumbered through
the Tetons and Jackson Hole, they slowly exact a toll
on this hard rock, continuing to carve, etch, and
abrade the range. They host life too: algae of a
reddish hue that give rise to the phenomenon called
watermelon snow.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">The Teton Range</h4>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/ig016.jpg" alt="Teton Range panorama" width="1000" height="499" />
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Any mountain range is the product of the struggle between
uplift and erosion, but in few places are the results
as clear as on the crest of the Teton Range. Today we do
not first see the Teton peaks across 160 kilometers (100
miles) of wilderness and then struggle to them afoot, on
horseback, or by wagon. This spectacle may break upon us
from the window of an airplane, or appear around a
bend in the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway.
The telescoping of time does not lessen the impact however.
The range&rsquo;s nearly even east base (see <a href="#Page_28">painting</a>) is the
best place from which to grasp its formation. Along this line
the valley ends at an abrupt wall, with no foothills at the
mountain&rsquo;s base. These are sure signs of faulting, the
elevation of a mountain block along a deep crack in the
Earth&rsquo;s crust. (See <a href="#fig12">diagram</a>.) Shatter lines
visible in many of the naked rock peaks show that the uplift
was no smooth ride. The Tetons are very young mountains
composed of very old rock. The range was thrust up
about 9 million years ago. Young? Yes, when compared
to the main Rocky Mountains, which rose 60 million years
ago, and the Great Smoky Mountains, which have been
above water more than 200 million years. The Teton
Range&rsquo;s crystalline rock is comparable to the 3-billion-year-old
Allegheny Mountains core. This hard, stable
rock, more than 300 times older than the mountains it
forms, is a boon to climbers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Another unusual feature of the Teton Range is its divide,
the division line at which water will flow off the mountains
either west into the Teton River or east into the
Snake. The Teton&rsquo;s divide lies well below and to the west of
the highest elevation. This is because the steeper east face
caused water to flow off faster and thereby to cut deeper.
These streams carved into the range and captured headwaters
from less erosive western streams. Erosion and
uplift continue competing in the range, which still rises
through periodic earthquake activity.</p>

</div>
<p>With only a brief itinerary in the park you might leave
Jackson Hole with a memory of the high peaks and just one
lake, much the impression that postcards give. But there
are dozens of lakes. Most must be sought off the highway behind
fringes of trees or up a short reach of trail. Some
nestle in the alpine heights. A checklist of park lakes based
on how they were formed includes surprising variety. A
few are oxbow lakes, cut off meanders of the Snake River.
Two are real oldtimers, Emma Matilda and Two
Ocean Lakes, formed about 30,000 years ago as the glaciers
melted back. But most are new glistening souvenirs
of the latest glacial advance that ended 8,000 years ago.
This newest crop is readily identified by the morainal
dams that back up each lake. Most easily recognized is the
morainal dam of Jenny Lake. Unlike Jackson (large photo),
Jenny, Bradley, Taggart, Leigh, and Phelps Lakes mark
surfaces gouged by mountain glaciers. The many small
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
ponds dotting the sagebrush flats, such as The Potholes,
are not gouge scars, but pits. Here glacial outwash materials
surrounded and buried small ice masses that later
melted. The technical term for these depression ponds is
kettle ponds, but The Potholes were named by a
rancher, not a geologist. The Tetons&rsquo; highest lakes are
called tarns (small photo). Bearing names such as Surprise,
Grizzly Bear, Bear-paw, and Rimrock, these are
diminutive versions of the glacial lakes at the foot of
major canyons. They originate in ice-scoured pockets
and are still forming under the small glaciers at the heads
of highcountry canyons. The largest and most heavily fished
lake is Jackson Lake. Cutthroat trout are native, but
lake trout (Mackinaw) were introduced in the 19th century.
The lake is 130 meters (425 feet) deep and 26 kilometers
(16 miles) long. Jackson, a natural lake, was dammed
before the park was established to store more water
and control the Snake River for irrigation in Idaho. The
Teton country&rsquo;s lake and pond environment has benefited
moose and ducks the most, but nearly all park
denizens&mdash;vacationing <i>Homo sapiens</i> included&mdash;appreciate
this aquatic resource. One species, the beaver, extends
its appreciation by creating more ponds. Once nearly exterminated
during the trapper&rsquo;s era, beaver are now abundant here.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">The Mountain World</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Above the tree limit and around snowfields and glaciers
lies the alpine tundra. This fragile ecosystem challenges
plant and animal survival with temperature extremes,
high winds, a short growing season, frequent drought,
and poor soil. Basic plant survival adaptations include
dwarfism, oversize root systems, matting growth, succulent
leaves or stems, and warmth-producing red pigments.
Some high mountain plants are almost brown, not
green, but perfectly alive. Dwarfism and matting keep
plants snugged low to the ground where conditions are
less severe than just a few centimeters higher. Animals
tend to adapt to subalpine and alpine rigors by modifying
their behavior rather than their structure. Exceptions include
flightless grasshoppers and the pika&rsquo;s fur-covered
feet.</p>
<p>The summer alpine tundra provides insects, seeds,
leaf crops, lichens, and fungi as wildlife food. For this short
season animals are well supplied and may become conspicuous.
Birds, with their advantage of flight, can cover
vast areas quickly in the search for food. They can also
readily change ecozones. A bird flying from alpine tundra
down to a forested slope makes a journey between
ecozones equivalent to migrating from above the Arctic Circle
to northern Maine. Hawks and eagles, in a regular
search for pikas or mice, can cover all of the Teton high
peaks in 2 hours or less.</p>

<h3 id="c5">The Valley</h3>
<p>With the Louisiana Purchase treaty signed, President
Thomas Jefferson wanted to know what he had
bought, so he sent the Lewis and Clark Expedition
overland to the Pacific in 1803 to find out. On the
return trip John Colter left the expedition along the
Yellowstone River to stay in the West and join a
trapping venture. He is considered the first white
person to discover what is now Jackson Hole. Colter
supposedly wandered through this high, mountain-encircled
valley&mdash;trappers called such valleys holes&mdash;in
the winter of 1807-1808. Colter was soon followed
by other trappers, and 40 years later the trappers
were followed by homesteaders. Several homesteaders
became dude ranchers, and their dudes
were followed by vacationers, who now number
nearly three million each year.</p>
<p>The flatness of Jackson Hole comes as a surprise,
considering that the Teton Range was formed by a
fault-block process. You would expect a deep valley,
but it has been filled repeatedly by rock debris
transported by glaciers and their meltwaters. The
Snake River does little cutting into the valley floor
today. The flat areas above the river, called benches,
were carved out when the river had the torrential
force of glacial meltwater. The river&rsquo;s north-south
flow shows that the valley slopes southward. The
valley also tilts westward, toward the fault that gave
rise to the Teton Range. For reasons not fully
known, the valley has sunk more than the mountains
have risen. We know this because a sedimentary cap
of rock atop Mount Moran&mdash;nearly 6,000 feet above
the valley floor&mdash;was once connected to the same
rock layer that now lies an estimated 24,000 feet
below the valley surface.</p>
<p>The glacial material that fills the valley is largely
quartzite rock rounded by tumbling in running water
into softball- to basketball-sized cobbles, supplemented
by gravel, sand, and silt. This rock came
from long-vanished mountains to the northwest. The
depth of the valleys cobble material is estimated at
perhaps about 2,000 feet. This cobble material has
been washed by glacial runoff so often that it lacks
the clay content that is essential for the ground to
retain water. Melting snow and rain rapidly percolate
through, so that only grasses and other plants
adapted to arid conditions can thrive in the valley&rsquo;s
coarse-textured soil. This is why sagebrush dominates
the valley floor, except where streams and
ponds provide enough water for willow bushes,
spruce, and cottonwood trees. Lodgepole pines grow
atop the recent glacial moraines that contain sufficient
nutrients and clay, such as the one surrounding
Jenny Lake.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Geologic forces have not always been subtle influences
in the valley. Melting snow and heavy rains in
June 1925 saturated a layer of clay sandwiched
between sedimentary rock layers that form the north
end of Sheep Mountain, near Kelly. An earthquake,
probably, triggered an enormous landslide, and thousands
of tons of debris raced down into the river,
damming it and backing up a lake 5 miles long and
200 feet deep. Two years later the top 50 feet of the
dam broke off and a wall of water rushed down
through Kelly, leveling all buildings except the church
and school. Six lives were lost, despite ample warning.
The landslide scar on Sheep Mountain&rsquo;s north
end is more than 5,000 feet long and 2,500 feet wide.
Geologists say that more of Sheep Mountain is
perched to slide, given similar spring rainfall and an
earthquake trigger.</p>
<p>The rise of the Teton Range and the corresponding
sinking of Jackson Hole continues, although not
at an even rate. The action continues by irregular
crustal movements known as earthquakes. Geologist
John D. Love, longtime interpreter of the dynamics
of the Teton Range, feels that a major earthquake
movement along the Teton fault, of as much as 20
feet, could happen at any time. The impact would be
many more times severe than the landslide and
ensuing flood at Kelly. But such things are not given
to easy and precise prediction.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">The Elk Herd</h4>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/ig024a.jpg" alt="Elk herd." width="1000" height="447" />
</div>
<p>The Jackson Hole elk herd is free ranging and migratory.
About half of its 15,000 elk winter on the National Elk
Refuge. By midsummer, many graze on bunchgrass in high
meadows near the Continental Divide, more than 110 kilometers
(70 miles) to the north. Moving north in spring, the
elk feed on succulent new growth of grasses and forbs
in the sagebrush flats. Cow elk, pregnant since last fall,
separate from the main herds to linger on calving grounds.
Newborn elk hide in sagebrush or aspen cover while
the cows feed. Elk tend to feed in the open in morning
and evening, retreating to forest shade during the day. All
summer they gain weight in preparation for winter. Full
grown cows often exceed 230 kilograms (500 pounds). Bulls
may stand 1.5 meters (5 feet) at the shoulder and weigh
405 kilograms (900 pounds). After their antlers drop off in
March, bulls begin growing a new annual set. Antlers, furry
nubbins in May, become velvet covered branches by July.
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
By late August the velvet, which supplied blood and nutrients
for rapid antler growth, hangs in tattered shreds as
bull elk rub their antlers against flexible saplings. In
September, mature bulls polish the velvet from their antlers
and join the cows on their summer ranges. Then
the dominant bull elk gather harems of 6 to 20 cows.
These bulls establish and maintain dominance by displaying
massive branched antlers, impressive bugling,
chasing off less aggressive bulls, and occasional combat
with other males. Fall migratory herds sometimes number
200 or more. Migration begins when the snow reaches
a critical depth. It is a special experience to witness this exodus
of elk streaming down the valley. Many elk return to
winter on the National Elk Refuge and in the Gros
Ventre drainage. Supplemental feeding is provided on
the refuge to maintain the Jackson Hole herd because
some two-thirds of its traditional winter range has been
lost to development. The remaining habitat, and the elk
hunt permitted by the law that added Jackson Hole to
the national park, is cooperatively managed by the National
Park Service and other Federal and State agencies to
perpetuate and protect the majestic elk of this great herd.</p>

</div>
<p>Shoshone, Crow, Blackfeet, Gros Ventre, and other Native
Americans hunted and picked berries in the valley in
summer, but winter was unbearable. During the early
1800s, solitary mountain men trapped valley beaver, sometimes
wintering through intense and deep snow. After
the fur trade collapsed in 1840, occasional trappers and
prospectors ventured into Jackson Hole. Well-known pioneers
built temporary cabins. Jackson Hole was settled late
in the frontier era, when limited technology, supply
routes, and food storage made winter bearable. The
first permanent settlers, John Holland and John Carnes,
homesteaded north of the town of Jackson in 1884. Significant
settlement came after 1900 as schools, post
offices, and churches were built. Jackson, Wilson,
Moran, and Kelly became the dominant communities.
Getting supplies and mail into Jackson Hole was always
difficult. Most supplies came from Idaho over rugged Teton
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
Pass. Pack horses and supply wagons then faced the Snake
River, often dangerous or impossible to cross. Menor&rsquo;s
Ferry, built at Moose in 1894 by William D. Menor, was a
major crossing until replaced by a bridge in 1927. Ferries,
and later bridges, at Wilson also improved valley transportation.
Most valley homesteaders became cattle
ranchers, grazing their herds on the public range and cultivating
enough hay for winter feed. But the harsh climate
and porous soils made ranching risky. When some
ranchers recognized the value of scenery and wildlife, they
began operating dude ranches and hunting lodges. In 1903,
Ben Sheffield catered to wealthy hunters from his
headquarters at Moran. In 1907, Louis Joy operated the
first dude ranch in Jackson Hole, the JY. The age of
tourism had begun.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h3 id="c6">The Snake River</h3>
<p>Grand Teton National Park and Jackson Hole have
no corner on the Snake River, boasting as they do a
mere 40 miles or so of the sinuous Snake&rsquo;s more than
1,000 miles of progress from the Continental Divide
near Yellowstone National Park to its confluence
with the mighty Columbia River near Pasco,
Washington.</p>
<p>Judging from its almost leisurely mid-summer passage
as a braided river through the park you would
not guess what chaos lies downstream. The river had
at least two names before the Snake was affixed.
A group of French-speaking trappers who crossed the
river in September 1811 encountered such difficulty
they decided to give it the name Mad River. Sometime
later this trapping party had to cross it again downstream
near its confluence with the Hoback River and
renamed it <i>La Maudite Rivi&egrave;re Enrag&eacute;e</i>&mdash;Accursed
Mad River. Those names properly hint at what lies
downstream as the Snake flows in every direction
but east in a great sickle-shaped curve, its watershed
embracing the largest chunk of wilderness in the
United States outside Alaska. The Snake&rsquo;s beautiful
Shoshone Falls in Idaho is a full 43 feet higher than
Niagara Falls. And the Snake&rsquo;s Hells Canyon, also in
Idaho, is North America&rsquo;s deepest and narrowest
major gorge, averaging a deeper gash across the land
than the Grand Canyon itself. Hells Canyon plunges
7,900 feet at its deepest point. What is more, it averages
5,500 feet deep over its course.</p>
<p>In a valley this high (the elevation of Jackson Hole
at the lower end measures 6,000 feet) the Snake
should have cut, with its steep gradients, permanent
channels. Instead, it still wanders in myriad channels
across the glacial debris filling the fault basin. Here
the Snake looks more like a prairie river rambling
with the restlessness of youth. Its banks are a
checkerboard of successional stages, as plant communities
rise and fall with disturbances created by
flooding, channel shifting, or fire. This benefits the
moose and beaver by assuring continual supplies of
willow and cottonwood that would otherwise soon
be succeeded by blue spruce.</p>
<p>The Snake, discovered by Lewis and Clark in 1805
but not fully explored until its headwaters were
pinpointed in 1970, is no longer a completely wild
river even in the park. Jackson Lake Dam, built
before the park was established, controls the water
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
flow below the lake, moderating natural surges that
used to follow rapid spring snowmelt or violent
summer thunderstorms. Since the river no longer
scours the valley regularly, these stabilized conditions
favor the development of larger tracts of blue
spruce.</p>
<p>Compared to the lakes, the Snake harbors a
wealth of aquatic life. A river is richer partly because
its linear structure provides more shoreline.
The plant complex that the river makes possible
continually enriches the water with leaves and other
debris. This energy subsidy, along with the countless
terrestrial insects caught by the river, is passed up
the food chain. Eventually the additional energy is
translated into the fish that help support the herons,
mergansers, eagles, ospreys, otters, and other terrestrial
predators that use the aquatic food pyramid.</p>
<p>The plant and animal composition of the riverine
world varies with the rate of water flow. In slow
water areas, such as the Oxbow Bend, where the
river has cut off and abandoned a former looping
meander, bottom-rooted aquatic plants attract herbivorous
animals&mdash;moose, mallards, golden-eyes, and
cinnamon teals&mdash;to graze these underwater gardens.
Such quiet stretches also attract carnivores to exploit
the greater variety of prey. Great blue herons
stand motionless along the shoreline, waiting to
spear passing fish or the mice, frogs, and snakes at
water&rsquo;s edge. Mink and coyote patrol the shoreline.</p>
<p>Insects are important river denizens, as the fly
fishing angler&rsquo;s art attests. The nymphs of mayflies
and stoneflies and the larvae of caddisflies eat algae
and other plant detritus, in the process becoming
attractive fare for the cutthroat trout and Rocky
Mountain Whitefish. The caddisfly larvae have
adapted to fast water by constructing protective
body cases from sand grains, pebbles, plant stems,
and other stream bed materials. The faster the
current, the heavier the case, which enables the
larvae to settle rapidly into a new cranny, should
they be swept away.</p>
<p>The sturgeon used to populate the Snake in what
are now park waters, but the erection of more than
20 hydroelectric and irrigation dams downstream so
changed the river that these very large fish are now
hard pressed to survive above the Columbia River
confluence.</p>

</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Jackson Hole witnessed the exploration, settlement, and
exploitation that characterized the opening of the West.
Early events centered around the fur trade and survey
expeditions. John Colter generally gets credit as the first
white man to visit the valley, purportedly crossing it in the
1807-1808 winter. Colter trekked west with Lewis and
Clark and got permission to leave them on their return
east. Other trappers whose names pop up before Jackson
Hole&rsquo;s fur trade died out in the 1840s are Jedediah Smith,
David Jackson, William Sublette, Kit Carson, and Jim
Bridger. All were inveterate explorers and adventurers.
Sublette probably named the valley, after his trading partner,
Jackson. The fur trade died out when beaver hats&mdash;the
prime pelt market&mdash;went out of fashion in Europe. By
then, beaver had been severely reduced over much of
North America, anyway, and a process for making felt from
far cheaper rabbit pelts had been developed. The first survey
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
expedition ventured into Jackson Hole in 1860, guided
by Jim Bridger. In command was Capt. William F. Raynolds,
topographical engineer. The War Department
conducted these early surveys to find out about the Indians,
farming and mining possibilities, and potential transcontinental
routes. Raynolds turned thumbs down on a rail
route here. In 1861 and 1862 gold seekers prospected the
valley but found nothing. An Interior Department mission,
the 1872 Hayden Survey led by Professor Ferdinand V.
Hayden, explored the Tetons and Jackson Hole, guided by
Beaver Dick Leigh.  Many Jackson Hole features are
named for Hayden Survey members. These include
Jenny, Bradley, Taggart, and Leigh Lakes. An expedition
led by Lt. Gustavus Doane nearly perished here in the
1876-77 winter and would have starved but for the fishing
skills of one private. The color illustrations are by
Jackson Hole artist John Clymer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No Indians made permanent,
year-round homes in Jackson
Hole. Winters were too severe.
Before white settlement,
a small, recluse Shoshone
group camped in the area for
as many months as possible
because of repeated raids
from northerly tribes who had
British-supplied guns. Other
Shoshone knew this small
band as Sheep Eaters, because
they depended on the
bighorn sheep for food. They
lived scattered in family
groups, not as a tribe. When
it seemed safe, they would
fish, hunt, and gather plants,
seeds, and berries. They used
dogs as beasts of burden.</p>

<img src="images/ig029a.jpg" alt="" width="398" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Codsiogo, a Shoshone warrior.</p>
</div>
<p>They made bows of elk antlers
and sheep horns reinforced
with elk and deer
sinews. Early trappers seldom
encountered the Sheep Eaters
although they sometimes saw
smoke from their fires. The
Sheep Eaters stayed near the
mountains until joining other
Shoshone under Chief Washakie
on reservations in
Idaho and Wyoming about
1879. Some artifacts and
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
other evidence of their life
are still found today in the
Tetons. Archeological studies
show that various Indian
groups migrated through here
on a seasonal basis. The
Shoshone peoples arose in
the semidesert Basin of the
upper Southwest. As food became
scarce they migrated
east of the Rockies, into the
plains and mountain parks of
Wyoming and Montana, probably
in the 1500s or mid-1600s.
In part they were escaping
slave-trading Ute Indians.
By 1730, however, records
begin to show the
Shoshone as the most important
plains tribe. They were
walkers until about 1740,
when they got Spanish horses
from the Comanches to the
south. Mounted, they would
raid as far as the Saskatchewan
River to the north and
the Black Hills to the east.
During the whites&rsquo; overland
migrations, the Eastern Shoshone,
under Chief Washakie,
avoided confrontations. But
Chief Washakie knew his
people&rsquo;s nomadic way of life
was over.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 17 species of fish in Grand Teton National Park
include brown, brook, rainbow, and lake (Mackinaw)
trout. These introduced species are found in a number of
lakes and streams. Perhaps the most impressive fish is the
Snake River cutthroat trout, the native trout so dependent
on the park&rsquo;s natural aquatic system. The deep red or
orange-red marks under its jaws give the impression of a
slashed throat, hence cutthroat. The Snake River cutthroat
is a distinct subspecies of the cutthroat trout identified
by the hundreds of tiny dark spots on both sides of its
body. In spring, particularly May and June, the Snake
River cutthroat will travel upstream into tributary waters
to spawn. The female digs a nest (called a redd) in the
gravel and the male and female lie side by side while simultaneously
contributing the sperm and eggs. The fertilized
eggs settle to the bottom and hatch into fry within 40
days. The young fish usually remain in the tributary stream
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
until fall but will sometimes wait a full year before migrating
to the river. Juveniles, called fingerlings, and sub-adults
feed on a variety of aquatic invertebrate larvae
such as caddisflies, mayflies, and stoneflies. The older fish
become more predaceous and feed on a variety of smaller
species of fish living in the river. The cutthroat trout
reach sexual maturity at three to four years of age. Few cutthroats
live longer than five years. The post-spawning mortality
rate is 50 percent. The Snake River cutthroat trout
indeed delights the angler, but more important is its role in
the wildlife community. The cutthroat consumes aquatic
insects, invertebrates, and small fish, helping to keep
these populations in check naturally. This trout is also
consumed, providing food for bears, eagles, ospreys, and
otters. If the fish population declines, so will the animals
that depend on it for food. As fishing pressure continues to
grow, park managers may have to protect this natural
population of Snake River cutthroat to maintain the
national park&rsquo;s wildlife community.</p>

<h3 id="c7">Wildlife and Wildflowers</h3>
<p>When the Shoshone Indians sat down with government
officials at Fort Bridger in 1863 to conclude a treaty
that would define their lands, the parcel that the
parties arrived at totaled 30,000 square miles. A
very small part of that was Jackson Hole, but this
was such rich hunting ground in summer and fall
that even the Shoshone dared not lay sole claim to it.
Blackfeet, Bannock, Crow, Gros Ventre, and probably
other tribes were drawn here to hunt. What
would you have seen on a hunting trip in those days?
Bison, pronghorns, and at least three times as many
elk as exist here now, but far fewer deer. Near
wall-to-wall beaver along the waterways, but nary a
moose. And bighorn sheep peering down at you
from nearly every crag and butte.</p>
<p>When settlement in the late 1800s at the south end
of the valley eliminated about two-thirds of their
winter range, as many as 500 elk sometimes ended
up on the streets of Jackson on frigid nights. Winter
starvation and poaching pressures took many elk.</p>
<p>The fur trade decimated beaver populations. But
what of moose, deer, and bighorn? Moose and mule
deer probably benefited from white settlement.
Moose increased because of the suppression of fire,
which permitted the increase of sub-alpine fir, a
winter food source. Moose graze but little grass,
mostly browsing coarser plants. Likewise mule deer.
Livestock overgrazing hindered elk but favored
moose and mule deer. The latter evidently usurped
bighorn wintering range, reducing the sheep population.
Wolves were extirpated and grizzly bears nearly
so. That favored&mdash;within range support limits&mdash;every
four-footed vegetarian not beset with other insurmountable
problems.</p>
<p>Grizzly bears roam only the northern part of
the park. Predation on large mammals must be
carried out by seldom seen black bears, rare
mountain lions, and coyotes, who largely feed on
rodents. Red foxes (rare here), lynxes, and bobcats
are crafty and formidable, but at best threaten
only the young of large mammals. Formidable
predators of a smaller scale are the many members
of the weasel family, including two weasels, the
badger, pine marten, wolverine and fisher (very rare
here), and mink. The prey of these creatures
includes many of the more familiar small mammals,
such as shrews, hares, chipmunks and golden-mantled
ground squirrels, Uinta ground squirrels, red and
flying squirrels, mice, pocket gophers, woodrats,
voles, and muskrats, and also small birds, bird eggs,
reptiles, and amphibians. Porcupines and beavers
are both large rodents and both feed on bark, but
their defenses differ. Beavers escape to their snug
lodge protected by the surrounding water, while
porcupines are protected by quills. But porcupines
sometimes fall prey to fishers and maybe smaller
cats and other critters able to get at their unprotected
faces and bellies.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The vigorous, brief blooms of alpine plants
edge a high mountain meadow, with only the tips of peaks as a backdrop.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Bird watchers are content here just to see the rare
trumpeter swan&mdash;on the Elk Refuge, or at Christian
and Hedrick Ponds. Other large birds include bald
eagles, ospreys, sandhill cranes, Canada geese, and
great blue herons. The water ouzel (dipper) walks
underwater in fast current, a marvel to behold. Bold
and brassy are the crafty magpies, who won&rsquo;t hesitate
to let you know if you annoy them. More than
100 species of birds have been identified in the park.</p>
<p>Four major natural communities provide a way of
understanding the park&rsquo;s wildlife patterns. The water
communities include lakes, ponds, rivers, and
streams. The sage and grassland community is the
most extensive and most often overlooked. The
forest community appears randomly distributed, but
soil moisture properties, the direction it faces,
elevation, and weather patterns influence where
trees grow. Blue spruce and cottonwood thrive along
valley streams. Aspen, Douglas-fir, and lodgepole
pine inhabit the valley and lower slopes. Sub-alpine
fir, Engelmann spruce, and limber pine stand on
mountainsides and in canyons. The edges where
communities meet are richest in wildlife. The alpine
community crowning the highcountry shares the
least characteristics and organisms with the other
three communities.</p>
<p>Water communities call to mind perhaps the trout
and beaver (see pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_48">48</a> and following), and lakes,
ponds, streams, and rivers interrupt or dot the other
three communities. In winter moose inhabit the river
flats to browse the cottonwoods and willows.</p>
<p>The pronghorn and sage grouse characterize the
wide open sage and grassland community, whose
purpose otherwise seems simply to provide the Teton
Range a foreground. This world is alive with small
birds feeding on masses of insects and spiders. These
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
songbirds, along with gophers, mice, and snakes,
provide the diet for weasels, hawks, and ravens. The
sage grouse depends largely on the evergreen sagebrush
for food. The pronghorns depend on it part-time,
being unable to subsist on grasses alone. This is
North America&rsquo;s fastest mammal, able to run at more
than 45 miles per hour. For added security it boasts
oversize lungs and windpipe, and the largest eyes by
body weight of any mammal. Faster yet is the prairie
falcon that hunts these flats, streaking out of the sky
at speeds up to 200 miles per hour.</p>
<p>An aspen grove of only 27 trunks may shelter more
than 12 pairs of birds&mdash;house wrens, mountain bluebirds,
swallows, and woodpeckers. It may also shelter
an understory of young spruce and fir that could one
day replace it. Deer and elk wander out of the forest
to browse the aspen, which can produce more than
2.5 tons dry weight of vegetation per acre. Ironically,
aspen have suffered somewhat in the park for lack of
forest fires. It turns out that fire suppression suppresses
aspens, which recover burned areas quickly.
In respect of natural processes, the park now practices
wildfire management instead of complete suppression,
except where human life and private property
might be threatened.</p>
<p>The alpine world (see pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_36">36</a>-37) stands as magic
for some. Its lilliputian scale fascinates. A tiny rabbit,
the pika (or cony), gathers grasses there all summer
in miniature haystacks you may discover. The yellow-bellied
marmot, on the other hand, stores fat, its
body being adapted to pass the winter in hibernation.
Surprising numbers of insects are found there.
And spiders wander the snowfields to feed on cold-sluggish
insects blown up from warmer elevations.</p>
<p>Diminutive alpine creatures aren&rsquo;t seen from a car,
but much of the park&rsquo;s wildlife bounty reveals itself
to casual observers. The national park tries to offer
the wild community a haven where natural processes
can work, but this is no simple task. The park
includes only portions of some creatures&rsquo; annual
ranges. And underlying the ideal balance of natural
processes are complex relationships we only gradually
unravel.</p>

is available in Yellowstone.</p>
<p>Some useful distances: Denver to
Grand Teton, 500 miles; Salt Lake City
to Grand Teton, 288 miles; and Idaho
Falls to Grand Teton, 105 miles.</p>
<p>Please note that public transportation
to and around the park is not
always regularly scheduled or frequently
available. If you intend to rely on bus
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
service for travel inside the park, plan
carefully and be prepared for long
waits between bus arrivals and departures
in parts of the park. Hitchhiking
is illegal in Wyoming.</p>
<h4>Taxi and Transportation Services.</h4>
<p>Local taxi service is limited, but it is
available. The Jackson Hole Transportation
Company, (307) 733-3135, provides
ground transportation for Teton
Village and Jackson to and from the
airport, and service to and from Flagg
Ranch on the Rockefeller Parkway.</p>
<h4>Air Service.</h4>
<p>Scheduled airlines serve
the Jackson Hole Airport, 7 miles north
of Jackson on Highway 26, 89, and 191.
Denver, Colorado; Salt Lake City, Utah;
and Idaho Falls, Idaho, all offer connecting
flights to Jackson. Flights arrive
and depart several times daily in
summer; less frequently in the off season.
Check with your travel agent for
flight schedules as well as ski package
rates for winter travel to the Jackson
Hole area.</p>
<h4>Car Rental Services.</h4>
<p>Avis (307) 733-3422,
Budget (307) 733-2206, Hertz (307) 733-2272,
and National (307) 733-4132
offer car rentals. All but Budget, which
provides airport pick-up and delivery,
are located at the Jackson airport.</p>
<p>All major park roads are two-lane
and paved. Summer months coincide
with road repairs and re-surfacing. It is
possible to have short delays (up to one
hour) while maintenance crews repair
old and build new road surfaces.</p>
<p>Many bicyclists ride along the narrow
Teton Park Road between Moose
and Colter Bay (see map). Traffic is
very heavy from mid-June to Labor
Day and both cyclists and motorists
should be alert to possible hazards.</p>

<h3 id="c11">Visitor Centers and Museum</h3>
<p>To best use your time, make your first
stop the Moose Visitor Center (south
end) or the Colter Bay Visitor Center
(north end). Ask the ranger at the desk
about park activities and services. And
ask for tips about what you can see
and do in the time you have. You may
even decide to lengthen your stay in
the Tetons.</p>
<p><b>Moose Visitor Center</b> includes information
services, a publications sales
outlet, and a backcountry and boating
permits office. This building also houses
the park headquarters and all
administrative offices. Summer hours
are 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.; from Labor Day
to mid-May 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The
visitor center is on the Teton Park
Road just west of Moose Junction.
Check the map in advance. With such
impressive scenery you can easily miss
this junction.</p>
<p><b>Colter Bay Visitor Center</b> includes the
Indian Arts Museum, free film showings,
a publications sales outlet, and a
backcountry and boating permits office
for the park&rsquo;s north end. Summer
hours are 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.; from Labor
Day to the end of September, 8 a.m. to
5 p.m.; closed from October to mid-May.
Check the map in advance and
watch for the sign that will direct you
to the Colter Bay area and its Colter
Bay Visitor Center, 6 miles north of
Jackson Lake Junction and 17 miles
south of Yellowstone National Park.
The Indian Arts Museum there houses
the extensive David T. Vernon Collection
of Native American Arts. Be sure
to inquire about museum tours and
Indian arts and crafts activities.</p>

<h4>Wayside Exhibits.</h4>
<p>As you drive through
the park on the main roads, take your
time and stop at the wayside turnouts
along the roads. At many turnouts
wayside exhibits identify the scene before
you and briefly interpret the natural
and human history of Jackson
Hole and the Teton Range. These turnouts
are usually located at excellent
scenic viewpoints and provide safe
parking areas for viewing and photographing
the mountain scene.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h3 id="c12">Ranger-led Activities</h3>
<p>From mid-June through Labor Day,
park rangers lead activities several times
daily throughout the park. These offer
ideal ways to see and understand the
many natural, historical, cultural, and
recreational resources the park offers.
These activities are listed in <i>Teewinot</i>,
the park newspaper, and are posted at
each visitor center and campground.
The <i>Teewinot</i> listing describes the event
and tells you where and when to meet.
There are short hikes, short hikes with
boat transportation, all-day hikes, wildlife
hikes, demonstrations, and campfire
programs. Rangers present interpretive
programs each night on a variety of
subjects throughout the summer at the
Gros Ventre, Signal Mountains, and
Colter Bay Amphitheaters. All ranger-led
activities are free except those
requiring modest fees for supplies or
transportation.</p>
<h4>Self-guiding Trails.</h4>
<p>Informative booklets
are available at visitor centers or
the trailheads to guide you on short-to-modest
hikes along established trails
that explore the history or nature of
the Tetons and Jackson Hole. These
walks are great for families and provide
exercise for building up to longer
hikes. Self-guiding trails include: Menor&rsquo;s
Ferry Historic Trail, Cascade Canyon
Trail, Cunningham Cabin Trail, Taggart
Lake Trail, Lunch Tree Hill Trail, and
Colter Bay Trail.</p>

<h3 id="c13">Camping and Accommodations</h3>
<p>The National Park Service operates
five campgrounds in the park on a
first-come, first-served basis. Reservations
are not accepted. A nightly fee is
charged. South to north (see map) the
campgrounds are: Gros Ventre, Jenny
Lake, Signal Mountain, Colter Bay,
and Lizard Creek. All except Jenny
Lake (tents only) accommodate tents,
trailers, and recreational vehicles. There
are no utility hookups. All campgrounds
have modern comfort stations. Maximum
stay is 7 days at Jenny Lake, 14
days elsewhere. In July and August the
campgrounds fill to capacity daily. Jenny
Lake fills by 8 a.m.; Signal Mountain
and Colter Bay fill between 10 a.m.
and 1 p.m.; Lizard Creek fills between
4 and 6 p.m.: and Gros Ventre by early
evening. There are trailer dumping stations
at Gros Ventre, Signal Mountain,
and Colter Bay. Colter Bay has showers,
laundry, and propane service.</p>
<p>Additional camping areas are found
in nearby national forests and elsewhere
outside the park. Camping is
not permitted along roadsides or in
overlooks or parking areas. Doubling-up
in campsites is prohibited. There are
no overflow facilities in the park. (Backcountry
campers, please see Backcountry
Basics.)</p>
<h4>Group Camping.</h4>
<p>There are 10 group
camping sites at Colter Bay and five at
Gros Ventre. Sites accommodate between
12 and 40 people. The nightly
use fee is $1.00 per person. These are
available to youth, religious, educational,
and other organized groups.
Reservations are required. Make them
as soon as possible after January 1, by
writing the chief ranger at the park
address.</p>
<h4>Trailer Villages.</h4>
<p>Concessioners operate
trailer villages with full hookups,
showers, and laundry at Colter Bay and
Flagg Ranch (in the Rockefeller Parkway).
Reservations are advised. For
Colter Bay write the Grand Teton Lodge
Company address (listed under Accommodations).
Write to Flagg Ranch
at Moran, WY 83013.</p>
<h4>Accommodations.</h4>

<p class="pcap"><i>Some of the park&rsquo;s most intriguing aspects reveal themselves only to hikers.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h3 id="c14">Hiking</h3>
<p>You may think time is fixed but it&rsquo;s not.
Its many speeds here include car time,
float time, horseback time, and hiking
time. Car time is, well, just car time.
Hiking time is Grand Teton time, Jackson
Hole time, your time. On great
days it&rsquo;s timeless time. There are more
than 225 miles of hiking trails in the
park.</p>
<p>The shortest trails are the self-guiding
trails 0.5 to 2 miles long. See the list
under Ranger-led Activities. The valley
trails that run along the base of the
Teton Range and take you to the large
lakes in front of the mountains are also
shorter and less arduous than the mountain
trails. The valley trails will pique
your interest and help you decide if
you wish to hike further into the mountains.
You can take a half-day to all-day
hike into the canyons between Teton
peaks. The walking will be more difficult,
requiring some up- and downhill
effort, but the rewards&mdash;mountain views,
wildflowers, and wildlife&mdash;are worth it.
You can take multiple-day trips over
highcountry passes and into the alpine
zone. A free backcountry permit is
required for all overnight camping.</p>
<p>In the visitor centers you can buy
the <i>Teton Trails</i> guide booklet. It offers
shaded relief trail maps, lengths
and hiking estimates, scenery identification
drawings, and photographs on
which you can trace your route. Rangers
can direct you to interesting hikes
and help you assess the level of difficulty.
If you plan to travel off trail you
must register at Jenny Lake Ranger
Station, or at the Moose Visitor Center
from October through May. Overnight
travel requires a free backcountry
use permit (see <a href="#c15">Backcountry Basics</a>).</p>
<p>Wear comfortable and sturdy footgear
no matter how far you hope to
travel. Even on shorter hikes, be sure
to carry raingear. Afternoon thundershowers
are common throughout the
hiking season and can occur suddenly.
The day may be sunny and warm, but a
quick drenching rain can spell big trouble
for hikers without raingear. Life-threatening
hypothermia occurs most
often in the 30 to 40&deg;F temperature
range, especially if clothing is wet and
there is some wind. Be prepared. Don&rsquo;t
take chances. You will also need to
carry water on your hike. At high
altitudes the sun is hot and the humidity
is low; you get thirsty quickly. Microorganisms
in stream water can cause
intestinal problems 10-14 days after
you drink, so use your canteen. (See
Water Warning under <a href="#c15">Backcountry Basics</a>.)
Be sure to carry lunch and some
high-energy snacks to munch on while
you walk. Add sunglasses, sunscreen, a
hat, and camera, and you will be prepared
to enjoy your day on the trail.</p>
<p>Please read Bear Warning under <a href="#c15">Backcountry Basics</a>.
Pets are not permitted
on trails or in the backcountry. Most
valley trails are open by early June.
Highcountry trails may remain closed
by snow until mid-July. Please note that
horse parties have the right-of-way on
trails. Step well off the trail and remain
quiet while horses pass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<h3 id="c15">Backcountry Basics</h3>
<p>Most basic is this: <i>Overnight backcountry
use requires a free backcountry
use permit.</i> This written permit can be
obtained at Moose Visitor Center, open
all year, or at Jenny Lake Ranger
Station and Colter Bay Visitor Center
in summer, on a first-come, first-served
basis. There are more people who
want a wilderness experience than
there is wilderness in the park, so
backcountry user capacities have been
established. This means that some people
are turned away. Reservations may
be made for backcountry camping
areas by mail only from January 1 to
June 1. These reservations by mail are
available for only 30 percent of the
backcountry camping sites. From June
1 to October 1, no reservations can be
made, and then all unreserved sites are
first-come, first-served. Organized
groups wishing to backpack overnight
should write the Permits Office at the
park address for full particulars.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Backpackers can readily
reach the heart of the Tetons
and enjoy pristine wilderness.
Good backcountry ethics ensure
protection of these wild
places and minimize conflicts
with bears</i>.</p>
</div>
<h4>Making a Reservation.</h4>
<p>Submit your <i>final</i> itinerary listing the specific sites
at which you wish to stay each night
(list calendar dates!) and the size of
your group (the maximum group size
is 12) to the Permits Office at the
Park address. See <a href="#cclosed">Closed Areas</a>.
You must still pick up your permit in
person by 10 a.m. of the day your
trip begins. A backcountry zone system
is used to minimize human impact
and to allow you freer choice in
camping. The Teton Range above
7,000 feet elevation has been divided
into camping zones. You may stay anywhere
within a zone if you follow these
simple rules: 1. No ground fires are
allowed. Small backpacking stoves are
recommended for cooking. 2. Camp
at least one mile away from any trail
junction or patrol cabin. 3. Camp at
least 100 feet away from all lakes and
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
streams. 4. Camp out of sight of the
trail and other campers. 5. Do not
camp in fragile or overused sites that
will show signs of your camp having
been there (unless told otherwise).</p>
<p>Below the 7,000-foot level there are a
few remaining designated lakeside backcountry
camping sites. Unless there is
a fire danger, wood fires are permitted
in the firegrates provided at these designated
camping sites.</p>
<h4>General Backcountry Regulations.</h4>
<p>Pets,
firearms, and wheeled vehicles are not
permitted. Carry out all refuse and
leave no evidence of your stay. Short-cutting
on trails is prohibited. Keep
stock out of camping areas. Use hitch
racks where provided. Do not tie stock
to live trees. To prevent pollution, do
not wash dishes or laundry in, and do
not bathe in, lakes and streams.</p>
<h4><a id="cclosed">Closed Areas.</a></h4>
<p>When you pick up your
permit, check on areas that may be
closed to backcountry use. No overnight
camping is permitted at Lake
Solitude, Bradley Lake, Taggart Lake,
Laurel Lake, Amphitheater Lake, below
the Forks of Cascade Canyon to
Jenny Lake, and the lower valley area
east of the Valley Trail and the east
shore of Jackson Lake. No overnight
camping is permitted along the Snake
River.</p>
<h4>Water Warning.</h4>
<p>Surface water is of
questionable purity. Carry water from
approved public supplies. Backcountry
water should be boiled for one minute,
three to five minutes at higher altitudes.
Water treatment disinfection chemicals
are not considered as reliable as
boiling to safeguard against <i>Giardia</i>
and <i>Campylobacter</i> intestinal disorders.
Most water filter mechanisms are not
adequate for these organisms. The evening
meal is an ideal time to boil water
for drinking and brushing teeth and for
the next day&rsquo;s use.</p>
<h4>Bear Warning.</h4>
<p>Black bears are sometimes
seen in the backcountry and in
campgrounds. They show little fear of
people and may try to get your food.
Federal law requires proper food storage
in the backcountry and in
campgrounds. Suspend food from a
tree (or bear pole if provided) or store
it out of sight in a vehicle. Your
backcountry permit packet includes
instructions on hanging your food. A
bear brochure is available free at ranger
stations and visitor centers. Make sure
everyone in your party reads this information
before your trip. Report all
bear sightings, damage, or injury to a
park ranger. Grizzly bears are seen
occasionally in northern parts of the
park. If a bear should charge you, climb
a tree or play dead. Don&rsquo;t try to run
away, however. Running excites the
bear, and you cannot outrun one.</p>
<h4>Theft from Parked Cars.</h4>
<p>Trailhead parking
areas are patrolled regularly, but in
recent years theft from cars parked
overnight has become more common.
Leave nothing of value visible in your
car and thoroughly lock up the vehicle
before leaving on your hike. It&rsquo;s best to
lock valuables in your trunk.</p>
<h4>Trip Planning.</h4>
<p>Write the Grand Teton
Natural History Association at the park
address for a list of sales literature and
maps to enhance your pre-trip planning
and enjoyment.</p>
<h4>Horseback Riding.</h4>
<p>For short rides with
a guide you can rent saddle horses at
Jenny Lake, Colter Bay, Flagg Ranch,
and Jackson Lake Lodge. Jenny Lake
Lodge and the Triangle X Ranch have
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
horses for guests only. A short horseback
ride gives you a leisurely look at
the park and a sample of Jackson Hole&rsquo;s
Old West flavor. If you&rsquo;ve never ridden,
or have not ridden in years, <i>make the
first ride short</i>. Your first steps after
first riding a horse for an hour or more
feel very strange! The concessioners
offer a variety of wagon rides and hay-rides
to cowboy cookouts. Guided trips
of several days can be arranged with
park concessioners. Or you can write
the chamber of commerce address for
information about area outfitters. If
you plan to bring your own stock, write
the chief ranger at the park address for
information on saddle and pack animal
use regulations. Also read the
<a href="#c15">Backcountry Basics</a> section. Please
note that no grazing is permitted in the
park; processed feed must be packed
in. Saddle and pack animal facilities
are available only at String Lake Parking
Area, Whitegrass Ranger Station,
and the Granite Canyon, Sheffield
Creek, Arizona Creek, and Pilgrim
Creek trailheads. Many highcountry
trails are blocked by snow until mid-July
and are impassable to saddle and
pack animals. For this reason many
horse parties camp on the adjoining
national forests and take day-trips into
Grand Teton National Park.</p>

<h3 id="c16">Mountaineering</h3>
<p>This is one of the country&rsquo;s finest areas
for general mountaineering. The rock
is mostly excellent, snow slopes mostly
moderate, and the range unusually accessible.
Still, many climbers pack in
and set up their camps in a highcountry
location. Mountaineering
guide service and instruction are available
at Jenny Lake. Write to: Exum
Guide Service and School of American
Mountaineering, Box 56, Moose,
WY 83012. Jackson Hole Mountain
Guides also offers guide services
in the park; write to Box 7477, Jackson,
WY 83001. Climbing guidebooks
and individual route guides are available
by mail from the Grand Teton
Natural History Association address
or can be purchased at park visitor
centers and the Jenny Lake Ranger
Station.</p>
<p>The Jenny Lake Ranger Station (see
<a href="#c10">map</a>) is the center for climbing information
and registration in the park
from early June to mid-September.
Climbing conditions are the best from
mid-July through late September, although
afternoon thundershowers are
common in these months and an extended
period of poor weather with
snowfall usually occurs in late August.
May and June feature long periods of
poor weather with heavy precipitation,
some snow, and subfreezing temperatures.
Heavy rockfall and some avalanche
activity are common. Major
storms occur in late September and
early October with snowfall and icing
conditions on most routes. Winter
weather in the Teton Range is severe:
heavy snowfall, high winds, and extreme
temperatures. Avalanche danger,
usually present, is frequently high
December to June.</p>

</div>
<h4>Registration and Information.</h4>
<p>Because of the hazards and possibility of accidents
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
in mountaineering, the National
Park Service requires all climbers to
register in person before climbing and
to sign out in person after climbing.
From early June to mid-September this
is done at the Jenny Lake Ranger
Station. It must be done at Moose
Visitor Center the rest of the year.
Notes left at the ranger station are not
acceptable registration or sign-outs.
(Climbers returning after the ranger
station is closed may sign out at the
Late-Returning Climbers Registration
Box on the ranger station porch.) Registration
is regulated under the Federal
Code of Regulations. The mountaineering
rangers on duty provide current
information on the nature and condition
of climbing routes, equipment and
experience requirements, and time
factors. Request general mountaineering
information from the chief ranger
at the park address.</p>
<p>Guidebooks, maps, and photographs
of various peaks and routes are available
at the Jenny Lake Ranger Station
to help you plan climbs. In winter&mdash;mid-September
through May&mdash;information
and registration are available
at the Moose Visitor Center. Conventional
mountaineering equipment is
satisfactory for summer climbs. Ice
axes are essential and crampons may
be desirable for early season climbs
and for some routes throughout the
season. Climbing helmets are strongly
recommended for technical climbs and
for climbs exposed to regular rockfall
dangers. Climbing equipment and food
suitable for backpacking may be purchased
in the area. Limited selections
of rental equipment may be available.
Low cost lodging for registered climbers
is available at Grand Teton
Climber&rsquo;s Ranch, an American Alpine
Club-operated concession. Write the
manager at Moose, WY 83012.</p>
<h3 id="c17">Boating and Floating</h3>
<p>Boat trips are offered by concessioners
on Jackson and Jenny lakes. These
vary from steak fry cruises to lunch
excursions, to drop-off and pick-up
cruises for hiking trips up Cascade
Canyon. On Jackson Lake concessioners
operate Colter Bay Marina, Leek&rsquo;s
Marina, and Signal Mountain Marina.
Marinas offer fishing guide service,
launching, marine supplies and fuel,
buoy rentals, and canoe rentals. Teton
Boating Company provides cruises, shuttle
service, and boat rental on Jenny
Lake. Canoe rentals for lake use only
are available from Moose Enterprises
at the grocery store in Moose.</p>
<h4>Floating.</h4>
<p>One of the best ways to experience
the park&rsquo;s wildlife and scenery
is by floating the Snake River. Numerous
concessioners offer guided float
trips in inflatable rubber rafts. Outfitters
are listed in <i>Teewinot</i>, or write to
the park address for a complete list.
(Please don&rsquo;t ask National Park Service
employees to recommend one over
another.) On a float trip you don&rsquo;t have
to watch the trail or mind the horse.
You just watch the animals and scenery
and listen to the guide&rsquo;s narrative,
wildlife identifications, and local lore.
The Teton Range appears to slide by,
now peeking above a massive river-cut
glacial moraine, now peeking through
trees, now disappearing from view. Morning
and evening floats are best for
seeing wildlife. You may well see bald
eagles, ospreys, moose, great blue herons,
Canada Geese, beaver, otters, and
various ducks. You can float the river
in your own craft, but a permit is
required. The river is floated in the
park from 1,000 feet below Jackson
Lake Dam to Moose, a distance of
about 25 miles. Do not attempt the
river on your own below Pacific Creek
(see <a href="#c10">map</a>) unless you are familiar with
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
your craft&mdash;kayaks, inflatables, and canoes
are best&mdash;and experienced on
rivers of similar difficulty and similar
hazards. People too often underestimate
the power of the Snake. Write the
park address for information about hazards,
regulations, equipment, and travel
times in floating the Snake River in the
park. Motorized craft are not permitted
on the Snake River.</p>

<h3 id="c18">Fishing</h3>
<p>Fishing is regulated in keeping with
the park&rsquo;s overall management objective
of maintaining natural systems
and scenic values. Most park waters
are open in season, subject to Wyoming
laws and National Park Service
regulations. These regulations are intended
to maintain quality waters, protect
natural fish populations, and
protect the food sources of bald eagles,
ospreys, otters, great blue herons, and
other native fish-eating wildlife. A Wyoming
fishing license is required and
may be purchased in the park at the
Colter Bay or Moose Tackle Shops, at
Signal Mountain, and at Leek&rsquo;s Marina.
Information on fishing laws and on
special regulations, including bait
restrictions, closed waters, artificial fly
fishing waters, and creel limits is available
at the visitor centers. You must
check on this information before you
fish. Fishing guides are available at the
lodges.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig97">
<img src="images/ig046a.jpg" alt="" width="253" height="600" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Popular
artificial fly patterns here
are:</i> <b>1</b> <i>Silver Spruce Matuka</i>,
<b>2</b> <i>Muddler Minnow</i>, <b>3</b> <i>Matts
Fur Nymph</i>, <b>4</b> Jay-Davis Hopper,
<b>5</b> <i>Royal Wulff, and</i> <b>6</b>
<i>Yellow Humpy</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>The park&rsquo;s waters support one of the
last wild inland populations of cutthroat
trout. The Snake River
cutthroat, a unique race of the cutthroat
species, is the only trout native
to the park. (See pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_56">56</a>-57.) The
National Park Service encourages you
to release small cutthroat carefully so
that the opportunity to catch this unusual
fish is perpetuated. Other gamefish
include rainbow, lake (Mackinaw),
brown, and brook trout and the Rocky
Mountain whitefish.</p>
<p>The use or possession of fish eggs&mdash;real
or artificial&mdash;or fish as bait in any
park waters are prohibited. (Some dead
non-game fish are permitted on the
shores of Jackson Lake only.) Get specifics
at a visitor center or write the
chief ranger at the park address for
fishing regulations and information.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<h3 id="c19">Winter Activities</h3>
<p>Winter activities gear up in mid-December.
Just one good storm can
turn Jackson Hole into a winter wonderland
covered with up to 6 feet of
snow in some years. In or near the park
you can then crosscountry ski, ice fish,
snowshoe, mountaineer, ice skate, snow-mobile,
and observe wildlife and scenery.
Minor park roads are not plowed
in winter. The Teton Park Road (see
<a href="#c10">map</a>) is closed from Cottonwood Creek
bridge to Signal Mountain Lodge. There
is no direct car access between Moose
and Teton Village. Yellowstone National
Park roads are not plowed in
winter.</p>
<p>Registration and information on
oversnow travel are available at the
Moose Visitor Center. Off-season camping
is available at Colter Bay across
from the visitor center, which provides
restrooms and water. Lodging is available
in winter at Flagg Ranch in
Rockefeller Parkway and at Triangle X
Ranch in the park. Nearby Jackson
offers full tourist services year round.
Write the chamber of commerce address
for information.</p>
<p>But you must prepare for the weather.
An average 4-foot base of snow in the
valley is much deeper in the mountains.
Daytime temperatures range from
-25&deg; to +50&deg;F. Severe winter storms
and blizzards can occur throughout
the season. All oversnow travel is prohibited
in the Snake River bottom between
Moose and Moran as well as in
the Willow Flats at Jackson Lake Lodge.
Check at the Moose Visitor Center for
exact boundaries on these closed areas.</p>

<h3 id="c20">Management Concerns and Safety</h3>
<p>Many management concerns and safety
tips are given under specific subjects in
this handbook. Here are other things
to consider. Camp only in designated
sites. Obtain a backcountry use permit
for all overnight backcountry use, including
in winter. Register at the Jenny
Lake Ranger Station in summer or
park headquarters in winter before starting
any off-trail hike or climb. Boat
permits are required for the use of any
watercraft on park waters. Fishing requires
a Wyoming license, and please
check park regulations at a visitor
center. Obtain an oversnow vehicle permit
at Moose Visitor Center and check
the regulations before operating a snow-mobile
or snowplane in the park. Bicycles
are not allowed on trails or in the
backcountry. <b>Pets must be leashed and
under physical restraint at all times.
They are not permitted on trails, in
buildings, or in the backcountry.</b> Kennels
are found in Jackson; check with
the chamber of commerce. All natural
features are protected; leave all rocks
and plants in their natural setting. All
park animals, including bears, are wild
and protected by law. Do not feed or
molest them. Please read the Bear
Warning under <a href="#c15">Backcountry Basics</a>.</p>
<h4>Driving Tips.</h4>
<p>Drive carefully and
defensively, especially at dawn, dusk,
and at night. Every season large animals
are killed and vehicles are mangled.
Slow down, and ask passengers to
help spot animals in the road. When
stopping to view wildlife, stop in turnouts,
be careful to stop your vehicle in
the safest position possible, with all
doors shut. Consider traffic flow problems
and their potential hazard. Be a
responsible driver. Keep motor vehicles
off bikeways. Report all accidents
to a park ranger. Observe posted speed
limits.</p>
<h4>Respect Wildlife.</h4>
<p>Keep a respectful
distance from all animals to avoid disturbing
their natural routine, especially
when taking pictures. Larger animals
are quick, powerful, and unpredictable.
Getting too close can result in
serious injury. Take special care to
avoid encounters with bears and to
help maintain their natural fear of humans.
Many small mammals can carry
diseases and should never be touched
or handled. All animals are part of the
natural processes protected within the
park. Allow them to find their own
food. Their natural diet insures their
health and survival. <i>Feeding wild animals
is prohibited no matter how
convincingly they beg.</i></p>
<h4>Fire Management.</h4>
<p>The park is zoned
for the management of natural fire. In
some parts of the park lightning-caused
fires are monitored and allowed to
burn, because we have learned that
natural fire often plays a vital role in
an ecosystem. Some plant species require
fire to thrive, and several animal
species benefit from fire. Natural fires
that threaten developed areas will be
extinguished to protect human life and
property. Report fires to a park ranger.
Human-caused fires will be extinguished.
Please be careful with fire yourself.</p>

<br />U.S. Department of the Interior</h2>
<p>As the Nation&rsquo;s principal conservation agency, the
Department of the Interior has responsibility for
most of our nationally owned public lands and natural
resources. This includes fostering the wisest use
of our land and water resources, protecting our fish
and wildlife, preserving the environmental and cultural
values of our national parks and historical
places, and providing for the enjoyment of life
through outdoor recreation. The Department assesses
our energy and mineral resources and works to
assure that their development is in the best interest
of all our people. The Department also has a major
responsibility for American Indian reservation communities
and for people who live in island territories
under U.S. administration.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
